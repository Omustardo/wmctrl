#   wmctrl is free software (open source software), a Unix command-line      #
#   tool for interacting with an EWMH/NetWM-compatible X Window Manager.     #
#                                                                            #
#   wmctrl was originally written by Tomas Styblo with contributions from    #
#   from others.  Its home page is http://tripie.sweb.cz/utils/wmctrl/.      #
#                                                                            #
#   The version here contains various enhancements that people around the    #
#   Net had added in their own divergent versions.  The two main sources     #
#   of these enhancements were https://github.com/dancor/wmctrl and          #
#   https://github.com/geekless/wmctrl.  The additions include these         #
#   new command-line options/actions:                                        #
#                                                                            #
#     -Y: iconify (Vadim Ushakov)                                            #
#     -S: sort window list in stacking order (Vadim Ushakov)                 #
#     -j: list current desktop (Kevin Der)                                   #
#     -r -y: like -e but reactivate after the move (Chris Piro )             #
#     -E: get-title (Dan Corson)                                             #
#     -z: lower window (Dan Corson)                                          #
#                                                                            #
#   Other improvements are a typo fix for the --help output, and some        #
#   fixes for build-time compiler warnings.                                  #
#                                                                            #
#   This repository also contains the full release history of wmctrl (one    #
#   commit per release), because it is based on the Conservatory archive     #
#   at https://github.com/Conservatory/wmctrl.                               #
#                                                                            #
#   I don't know if Tomas Styblo still accepts bug reports for wmctrl, as    #
#   the last version he released was 1.07 in January 2005.  Please feel to   #
#   file bug reports and enhancements here.  Although I don't consider this  #
#   copy to be "official", and can't commit to putting in much effort as     #
#   a maintainer, I'll try to review and merge easy fixes and enhancements.  #
#                                                                            #
#   Below is the original content of the upstream 1.07 README.               #
#                                                                            #

A command line tool to interact with an EWMH/NetWM compatible X Window Manager.

To compile and install the program, run the following commands:

After installation you may run "wmctrl -h" to view the documentation.


The program is based on the EWMH specification:

Please note that wmctrl only works with window managers which implement
this specification.

I recommend you to check out Zenity, which is an excellent
tool to integrate the GUI and the command line.
