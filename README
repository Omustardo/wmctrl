#   wmctrl is free software (open source software), a Unix command-line      #
#   tool for interacting with an EWMH/NetWM-compatible X Window Manager.     #
#                                                                            #
#   wmctrl was originally written by Tomas Styblo with contributions from    #
#   from others.  Its home page is http://tripie.sweb.cz/utils/wmctrl/.      #
#                                                                            #
#   The version here is enhanced with various changes that people around     #
#   the Net had added in their own divergent versions.  This version is      #
#   meant to gather all of those improvements together in one place.         #
#   It also contains the full release history of wmctrl (one commit          #
#   per release) because it starts from the Conservatory archive at          #
#   https://github.com/Conservatory/wmctrl.  The relevant part of the        #
#   Conservatory's README is below, lightly edited.                          #
#                                                                            #
#   =====================================================================    #
#                                                                            #
#   Because wmctrl does not appear to have any publicly accessible version   #
#   control repository, we created a Conservatory Git repository for it.     #
#   We don't know if Tomas Styblo still accepts bug reports for wmctrl,      #
#   but if you run into a bug you could try reporting it to him and see      #
#   what happens.  (As of this writing on 2018-09-09, the latest official    #
#   wmctrl release was 1.07 in January 2005.)  Please also feel free to      #
#   file bugs here.  Although I don't consider this copy of wmctrl to be     #
#   "official" and I'm certainly not committing to maintain it, I'll merge   #
#   easy fixes or enhancements if they don't take too much time to review.   #
#                                                                            #
#   About the Conservatory copy of wmctrl that this started from:            #
#   -------------------------------------------------------------            #
#                                                                            #
#   The Conservatory (https://conservatory.github.io/) is a place where      #
#   free software that has no other public version-controlled home on the    #
#   Internet is made available in a git repository.  For wmctrl, we started  #
#   from http://tripie.sweb.cz/utils/wmctrl/dist/wmctrl-1.07.tar.gz and      #
#   then deduced the names of the previous releases.  We have committed      #
#   each upstream release as one git revision, starting from 1.00, using     #
#   https://github.com/Conservatory/conservatory.github.io/blob/master/\     #
#   conservatory-import and the upstream ChangeLog to automate the process.  #
#                                                                            #
#   There are other version-controlled copies of wmctrl on the Internet.     #
#   We found at least these two, and there may be others:                    #
#                                                                            #
#     * https://github.com/geekless/wmctrl                                   #
#                                                                            #
#       Adds -Y (iconify) and -S (sort in stacking order) options.           #
#       Also backports some 64-bit-data fixes from a Debian patch.           #
#                                                                            #
#     * https://github.com/dancor/wmctrl                                     #
#                                                                            #
#       Adds -j (list current desktop), -z (lower window),                   #
#       and some other interesting new options.                              #
#                                                                            #
#   Those two started from a top-skim of wmctrl 1.07, though, so they        #
#   didn't preserve the full upstream release history.  Later @kfogel        #
#   cloned the Conservatory copy and then merged those enhancements into     #
#   his copy.  Below is the original content of the upstream README file.    #
#                                                                            #

I recommend you to check out Zenity, which is an excellent 
tool to integrate the GUI and the command line.
